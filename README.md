# LanguageModel_RNN
Project for learning RNN by following Denny Britz's post from his blog(http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano). Hopefully, I can use tensorflow to improve the training efficient instead of Theno, since I am also learning to use Tensorflow to train RNN.
